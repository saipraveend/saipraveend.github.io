## 🎯 What is This?

Welcome to my digital lab! This is where I'll be sharing:

- **Quick Experiments**: AI models running on embedded hardware
- **Prototypes**: Early-stage ideas and proof-of-concepts
- **Learnings**: Both successes and failures in real-time
- **Ideas**: Hardware + AI combinations worth exploring

## 🧪 Current Focus Areas

### TinyML & Edge AI
Exploring how to run machine learning models on resource-constrained devices like Arduino, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi.

### Computer Vision on Hardware
Building real-world applications with cameras and embedded processors for object detection, tracking, and recognition.

### IoT + Intelligence
Combining connectivity with smart algorithms for autonomous systems and intelligent sensors.

## 🛠️ The Approach

Unlike my polished project pages, the Lab is meant to be:

- **Raw**: Work in progress, rough edges included
- **Iterative**: Updated as experiments evolve
- **Honest**: Failed experiments are just as valuable as successful ones
- **Fast**: Quick to document, minimal friction to share

## 💡 Why This Matters

The field of AI + embedded hardware is moving incredibly fast. By documenting experiments in real-time, I can:

1. Track learning and progress over time
2. Share practical insights beyond theory
3. Connect with others exploring similar challenges
4. Build a knowledge base for future projects

## 🚀 What's Coming

I'm currently exploring:

- Running TensorFlow Lite models on ESP32-CAM
- Audio keyword spotting with Arduino Nano 33 BLE
- Custom sensor fusion for robotics applications
- Power optimization for always-on AI devices

Stay tuned for updates, and feel free to reach out if you're working on similar projects!
