## What's This About?

This is my experimental space. Unlike the project pages where everything is polished and complete, here I'm sharing stuff while I'm still figuring it out.

You'll find:
- Quick tests with AI on microcontrollers
- Early prototypes that may or may not work
- Things that failed (those are valuable too)
- Ideas I'm testing before committing to full projects

## What I'm Working On

**TinyML & Edge AI**
Trying to get ML models running on small boards like ESP32 and Arduino. Turns out fitting neural networks into 2MB of flash is interesting.

**Computer Vision on Hardware**
Cameras + microcontrollers + object detection. Seeing how far I can push cheap hardware before needing a Pi or Jetson.

**IoT with Some Intelligence**
Sensors that do more than just send data — adding local processing and smarter decision-making.

## The Ground Rules

- Posts will be rough. I'm documenting as I build.
- Failed experiments count. Actually, they're more interesting sometimes.
- I'll update posts as experiments evolve instead of waiting until everything's perfect.
- Quick to share means more content, even if it's messier.

## What's Next

Currently testing:
- TensorFlow Lite on ESP32-CAM
- Audio keyword spotting with Arduino Nano 33 BLE
- Sensor fusion for a small robot
- Power optimization tricks for always-on devices

If you're working on similar stuff, let's connect.
