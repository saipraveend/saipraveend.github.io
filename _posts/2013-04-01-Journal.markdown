<p>The aim of the project was to analyse, control, design and implement a Distribution Static Synchronous Compensator (DSTATCOM).</p> 

<p>A DSTATCOM is a shunt compensation device for reactive power compensation. It can be operated either in power factor correction mode or in voltage regulation mode, hence improving the system stability. In this thesis, a state space model of DSTATCOM is developed. Control algorithms based on instantaneous reactive power theory is derived and the performance of the DSTATCOM is studied using simulations in MATLAB/Simulink environment. The simulation results are validated through a 4kVA laboratory prototype, with closed loop control system implemented on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) using Xilinx software. </p>
