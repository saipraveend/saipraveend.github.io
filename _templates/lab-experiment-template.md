## What I'm Trying

The goal. What question are you answering? What are you trying to make work?

## The Setup

**Hardware:**
- Board: ESP32/Arduino/Pi/whatever
- Sensors/peripherals you're using
- How it's connected

**Software:**
- Framework or library
- Model (if ML)
- Dev environment

## The Experiment

### What I Did

First attempt, what you tried, how you set it up.

### What Happened

Results. Did it work? Partially work? Fail completely?

Include numbers if you measured anything:
- Latency: X ms
- Accuracy: Y%
- Power draw: Z mA
- etc.

### Problems Hit

List what went wrong (there's always something):
- Problem 1: What broke and what you tried
- Problem 2: Another issue
- Problem 3: etc.

## What I Learned

The valuable part. Even if it totally failed, what did you figure out?

Things that surprised you. Assumptions that were wrong.

## Code & References

- Code: [GitHub gist or repo](link) - even if messy
- Helpful tutorial: [Link]
- Paper/article that helped: [Link]
- Dataset: [Link if using one]

## Next

What you're going to try next:
- [ ] Thing to test
- [ ] Another thing
- [ ] One more thing

Or if it failed hard: what you'd do differently if you tried again.

**Last updated:** YYYY-MM-DD

Note: This is a work in progress. Will update as I continue testing.
