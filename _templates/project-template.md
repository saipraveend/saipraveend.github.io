## What This Is

Quick intro - what problem were you solving? Why did you build this?

## What It Does

- Main feature 1
- Main feature 2
- Main feature 3

Keep it simple. Details come later.

<div class="side-by-side">
    <div class="toleft">
        <img class="image" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/your-project/image1.jpg" alt="Project photo">
        <figcaption class="caption">What you're showing here</figcaption>
    </div>
    <div class="toright">
        Why this photo matters. What's interesting about what you built here.
        Technical details that explain the image.
    </div>

## How It Works

Break this into logical sections based on your project:

### Setup / Assembly

How you put the hardware together. Include photos if you have them.

### The Code

Main logic, algorithms, anything interesting you figured out.

### Testing

What worked first try (probably nothing), what you had to fix.

---

## Results

Did it work? How well? Numbers if you have them.

Photos or videos of it actually running.

## What I Learned

This is valuable. What broke? What would you do differently?

Things that surprised you. Mistakes you won't make again.

## What's Next

Ideas for v2. Things you didn't have time for.

Keep it real - you might never actually do these, but they're worth noting.
